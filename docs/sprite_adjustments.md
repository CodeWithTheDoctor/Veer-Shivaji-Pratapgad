# ðŸŽ® Sprite & Gameplay Adjustments

## âœ… Changes Applied

### **1. Sprite Size Increased**

- **Problem**: Character sprites were too tiny
- **Solution**: Added `scale = Vector2(1.5, 1.5)` to AnimatedSprite2D
- **Result**: Shivaji is now 50% larger (more visible and detailed)
- **File Modified**: `characters/Shivaji.tscn`

### **2. Jump Height Reduced**

- **Problem**: Character jumps were too high
- **Solution**: Changed `jump_velocity` from `-600.0` to `-450.0`
- **Result**: 25% lower jumps, more controlled platforming
- **File Modified**: `scripts/characters/Player.gd`

## ðŸŽ¯ What You'll Notice

### **Sprite Changes:**

- âœ… **Shivaji appears 1.5x larger** (48x96 pixels instead of 32x64)
- âœ… **More detailed and visible** character
- âœ… **Same smooth animations** (idle, walk, jump)
- âœ… **Collision detection unchanged** (still uses original 32x48 collision box)

### **Jump Changes:**

- âœ… **Lower, more controlled jumps**
- âœ… **Better for precise platforming**
- âœ… **Same jump responsiveness**
- âœ… **Gravity and other physics unchanged**

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### **Scale Implementation:**

```gdscript
# In Shivaji.tscn - AnimatedSprite2D node
scale = Vector2(1.5, 1.5)  # 150% of original size
```

### **Jump Physics:**

```gdscript
# In Player.gd
@export var jump_velocity: float = -450.0  # Was -600.0
# Negative values = upward velocity
# Less negative = lower jumps
```

## ðŸŽ® Test the Changes

1. **Run the game** (Godot editor should still be open)
2. **Press F5** to play
3. **Test movement**:
   - **WASD/Arrows** - Notice larger, more visible Shivaji
   - **Space** - Try jumping, should feel more controlled
   - **Movement** - Same responsive controls

## ðŸ”§ Further Adjustments

If you want to fine-tune more:

### **Make Sprites Even Bigger/Smaller:**

```gdscript
# In Shivaji.tscn - AnimatedSprite2D
scale = Vector2(2.0, 2.0)    # Double size
scale = Vector2(1.2, 1.2)    # Just 20% bigger
```

### **Adjust Jump Height:**

```gdscript
# In Player.gd
@export var jump_velocity: float = -350.0   # Even lower jumps
@export var jump_velocity: float = -500.0   # Slightly higher jumps
```

### **Adjust Movement Speed:**

```gdscript
# In Player.gd
@export var speed: float = 250.0   # Slower movement
@export var speed: float = 400.0   # Faster movement
```

## ðŸŽ‰ Ready to Test

Your character should now be:

- **âœ… More visible** (1.5x larger sprites)
- **âœ… Better jumping** (25% lower, more controlled)
- **âœ… Same smooth gameplay** (all other mechanics unchanged)

Let me know how it feels now! ðŸŽ®âœ¨
