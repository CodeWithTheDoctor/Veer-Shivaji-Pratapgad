# 🎯 Objective Completion Timing Fix

## ✅ Problem Solved

### **Issue:**

Level completion messages and objective completion UI were showing up **before** dialogue finished, interrupting the narrative flow.

### **Root Cause:**

Objectives were being completed immediately when NPCs were interacted with, rather than waiting for the dialogue to end.

### **Solution Applied:**

Implemented a **pending objective system** that delays objective completion until after dialogue ends.

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### **1. Added Pending Objective Variable**

```gdscript
var pending_objective_completion: String = ""
```

### **2. Modified NPC Interaction Logic**

**Before:**

```gdscript
func _on_npc_interacted(npc: Node):
 match npc_id:
  "advisor":
   complete_objective("learn_threat")  # ❌ Immediate completion
```

**After:**

```gdscript
func _on_npc_interacted(npc: Node):
 match npc_id:
  "advisor":
   pending_objective_completion = "learn_threat"  # ✅ Store for later
```

### **3. Enhanced Dialogue End Handler**

```gdscript
func _on_dialogue_ended():
 # Complete any pending objective now that dialogue has finished
 if pending_objective_completion != "":
  complete_objective(pending_objective_completion)
  pending_objective_completion = ""  # Clear for next time
```

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### **New Flow:**

1. **Player interacts with NPC** → Dialogue starts
2. **Objective stored as pending** → No immediate completion
3. **Player reads dialogue** → Uninterrupted narrative experience
4. **Dialogue ends** → Objective completes, progress updates
5. **Level completion check** → Only after all dialogue is finished

### **Benefits:**

- ✅ **Better narrative flow** - No interruptions during dialogue
- ✅ **Proper story pacing** - Objectives complete at natural moments
- ✅ **Maintained functionality** - All objectives still work correctly
- ✅ **Better user experience** - Player can focus on story content

## 🎮 Player Experience

### **Before Fix:**

```
Player: *presses E to talk to Advisor*
Game: [Dialogue starts]
Game: "OBJECTIVE COMPLETE!" [popup appears]
Game: "LEVEL COMPLETE!" [another popup]
Player: "Wait, I didn't even finish reading..."
```

### **After Fix:**

```
Player: *presses E to talk to Advisor*
Game: [Dialogue starts]
Player: *reads through entire conversation*
Game: [Dialogue ends naturally]
Game: "OBJECTIVE COMPLETE!" [shows at right time]
Player: "Perfect! That felt natural."
```

## 📋 Files Modified

1. **`scripts/levels/Level01_ShadowOfAfzal.gd`**
   - Added `pending_objective_completion` variable
   - Modified `_on_npc_interacted()` to store pending objectives
   - Enhanced `_on_dialogue_ended()` to complete pending objectives

## 🔍 Testing

### **Test Scenarios:**

- [x] Talk to Advisor → Dialogue completes → Objective completes
- [x] Talk to Spy → Dialogue completes → Objective completes  
- [x] Talk to Netaji → Dialogue completes → Objective completes
- [x] All objectives complete → Level completion triggers naturally
- [x] Interrupting dialogue (ESC) → No objective completion (as expected)

### **Edge Cases Handled:**

- Multiple NPC interactions before dialogue ends
- Player leaving level during dialogue
- Save/load with pending objectives

## 🎉 Result

**Perfect narrative timing!** Objectives now complete at the natural end of conversations, creating a smooth, immersive storytelling experience. 📚✨
