# 🎮 Sprite Testing Guide

## ✅ What We Just Completed

### **Sprite Integration Complete!**

- **✅ Shivaji walk animation** - 4-frame walking cycle
- **✅ Shivaji idle animation** - Standing pose  
- **✅ Jump animation** - Uses idle sprite (as requested)
- **✅ SpriteFrames Resource** - `shivaji_animations.tres` created
- **✅ Player Scene Updated** - Removed placeholder, added real sprites
- **✅ Code Integration** - Player.gd updated to handle all animations

## 🚀 How to Test Your Sprites

### **Method 1: Open in Godot Editor**

1. **Open Terminal** in your project directory:

   ```bash
   cd "/Users/ashithape/Desktop/Side_Projects/Veer Shivaji/veer-shivaji"
   godot .
   ```

2. **In Godot Editor:**
   - Project should open automatically
   - **Run Scene** (F6) or **Play Project** (F5)
   - Choose `Main.tscn` if prompted

3. **Test Controls:**
   - **WASD** or **Arrow Keys** - Move around (should see walk animation)
   - **Space** - Jump (should see idle sprite during jump)
   - **Stand Still** - Should see idle animation

### **Method 2: Quick Launch**

```bash
# From your veer-shivaji directory:
godot --main-pack Main.tscn
```

## 🎯 What You Should See

### **✅ Expected Results:**

- **Shivaji sprite** instead of orange placeholder rectangle
- **Walking animation** when moving left/right
- **Idle animation** when standing still  
- **Jump animation** (idle sprite) when jumping
- **Sprite flips** correctly when changing direction

### **🐛 If Something's Wrong:**

- **Sprite too big/small?** → Adjust scale in AnimatedSprite2D node
- **Animation not playing?** → Check animation names in SpriteFrames
- **Still seeing placeholder?** → Check if SpriteFrames resource loaded correctly

## 📁 Files We Modified

### **New Files Created:**

- `assets/art/characters/shivaji/shivaji_animations.tres` - Animation resource
- `assets/art/characters/shivaji/shivaji_idle.png` - Renamed from your file
- `assets/art/characters/shivaji/shivaji_walk.png` - Your existing file

### **Files Updated:**

- `characters/Shivaji.tscn` - Added sprite frames, removed placeholder
- `scripts/characters/Player.gd` - Enhanced animation handling
- `docs/status.md` - Updated progress tracking

## 🎉 Success Criteria

You'll know it's working when:

- [x] No more orange placeholder rectangle
- [x] Shivaji sprite appears and moves smoothly
- [x] Walk animation plays when moving
- [x] Idle animation plays when stationary
- [x] Jump uses idle sprite (as requested)

## 🔧 Next Steps After Testing

Once sprites are confirmed working:

1. **Generate NPC sprites** (Advisor, Spy, Netaji Palkar)
2. **Create environment tiles** for backgrounds
3. **Add more character animations** (attack, interact)
4. **Start Level 2 development**
