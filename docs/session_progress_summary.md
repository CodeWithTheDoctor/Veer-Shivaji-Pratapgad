## ðŸš€ **RECOMMENDED NEXT SESSION PLAN**

### **Session Focus: NPC Sprites**

1. **Generate NPC sprites using AI** (same process as Shivaji)
2. **Animate in Piskel** (idle animations sufficient for stationary NPCs)
3. **Integrate into Level 1** (replace placeholder sprites)
4. **Test full Level 1 experience** with all character sprites

### **Success Criteria:**

- All 3 NPCs have proper sprites instead of placeholders
- Level 1 looks like a real game with character art
- Smooth interaction with all visual NPCs

## ðŸ“Š **CURRENT COMPLETION STATUS**

- **Visual Assets**: 25% â†’ **Target: 50%** (after NPC sprites)
- **Core Gameplay**: 100% âœ… **COMPLETE**
- **Story Content**: 20% (Level 1 only)
- **Audio Integration**: 5% (framework only)
- **Educational Features**: 80% âœ… **NEARLY COMPLETE**

## ðŸŽ¨ **NEXT LOGICAL STEP**

**CREATE NPC SPRITES** using the same workflow we perfected for Shivaji:

1. **AI Generation** - Use prompts for Advisor, Spy, Netaji Palkar
2. **Piskel Animation** - Simple idle animations
3. **Godot Integration** - Replace placeholder NPCs
4. **Visual Polish** - Level 1 will look like a real game!

This will give you a **fully visual Level 1** with all characters having proper sprites, making it feel like a complete, professional game experience! ðŸŽ®âœ¨
