# ðŸŽ¨ Advisor Sprite Integration

## âœ… Integration Complete

### **What Was Added:**

- **Advisor sprite**: `assets/art/characters/advisor/advisor-idle.png` (32x64 pixels)
- **NPC sprite system**: Enhanced to support real sprites instead of just placeholders

### **Technical Changes:**

#### **1. Enhanced NPC Script (`scripts/characters/NPC.gd`)**

```gdscript
@export var sprite_texture: Texture2D  # New property for sprite textures

# Updated setup_npc() function:
if sprite_texture:
    sprite.texture = sprite_texture
    sprite.scale = Vector2(1.5, 1.5)  # Same scale as Shivaji
else:
    # Fallback to blue placeholder rectangle
```

#### **2. Updated Level01 NPC Creation (`scripts/levels/Level01_ShadowOfAfzal.gd`)**

```gdscript
# Assign specific sprites for each NPC
match npc_data.id:
    "advisor":
        npc.sprite_texture = load("res://assets/art/characters/advisor/advisor-idle.png")
    "spy_merchant":
        # Uses placeholder for now
    "netaji_palkar":
        # Uses placeholder for now
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Current NPC Status

### **âœ… Advisor NPC:**

- **Sprite**: Real advisor sprite (32x64 px)
- **Scale**: 1.5x for visibility (same as Shivaji)
- **Position**: Platform in Level 1
- **Functionality**: Full dialogue and objective completion

### **ðŸ”„ Other NPCs:**

- **Spy Merchant**: Blue placeholder rectangle (ready for sprite)
- **Netaji Palkar**: Blue placeholder rectangle (ready for sprite)

## ðŸŽ® Testing

### **How to Test:**

1. **Run the game** (F5 in Godot)
2. **Navigate to the advisor** (on one of the platforms)
3. **Look for the advisor sprite** instead of blue rectangle
4. **Interact with E** - Should work normally with dialogue

### **Expected Results:**

- âœ… **Advisor shows real sprite** (elderly character in traditional robes)
- âœ… **Sprite scaled properly** (1.5x, same as Shivaji)
- âœ… **Other NPCs still blue placeholders** (spy, netaji)
- âœ… **All interactions work normally**

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### **Ready for More Sprites:**

The system is now set up to easily add more NPC sprites:

1. **Add spy sprite**: Place in `assets/art/characters/spy/`
2. **Add netaji sprite**: Place in `assets/art/characters/netaji_palkar/`
3. **Update Level01 script**: Add to the match statement
4. **Test**: All NPCs will have real sprites

### **Scalable System:**

- âœ… **Automatic scaling** (1.5x for all NPC sprites)
- âœ… **Fallback system** (placeholder if no sprite)
- âœ… **Easy to extend** (just add to match statement)
- âœ… **Consistent with player** (same scale as Shivaji)

## ðŸŽ‰ Result

**Level 1 now has a real Advisor character!** No more blue rectangle for the advisor - now it's a proper character sprite that matches the game's visual style. ðŸŽ­âœ¨
