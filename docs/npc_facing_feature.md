# ðŸŽ­ NPC Facing Player Feature

## âœ… Feature Added

### **What It Does:**

NPCs now automatically turn to face the player character when you interact with them, making conversations feel more natural and engaging.

### **How It Works:**

#### **1. Player Detection:**

```gdscript
# NPCs find the player using groups (fast and reliable)
var player = get_tree().get_first_node_in_group("player")
# Fallback method if group isn't found
player = get_parent().get_node_or_null("Player")
```

#### **2. Direction Calculation:**

```gdscript
if player_position.x < npc_position.x:
    sprite.flip_h = true   # Player is left, face left
else:
    sprite.flip_h = false  # Player is right, face right
```

#### **3. Automatic Triggering:**

- Happens **automatically** when you press E to interact
- Occurs **before** dialogue starts
- Works for **all NPCs** (Advisor, Spy, Netaji)

## ðŸŽ® Player Experience

### **Before:**

```
Player approaches NPC from behind
Player: *presses E*
NPC: "Hello!" (still facing away - awkward!)
```

### **After:**

```
Player approaches NPC from behind  
Player: *presses E*
NPC: *turns around to face player*
NPC: "Hello!" (natural eye contact!)
```

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### **Files Modified:**

#### **1. `scripts/characters/NPC.gd`**

- Added `face_player()` function
- Enhanced `interact()` to call facing logic
- Robust player detection with fallback

#### **2. `scripts/characters/Player.gd`**  

- Added player to "player" group for easy NPC detection

### **Code Structure:**

```gdscript
func interact():
    face_player()           # Turn to face player first
    start_dialogue()        # Then start conversation
    emit_interaction()      # Then trigger objectives

func face_player():
    find_player()           # Locate player character
    calculate_direction()   # Determine left/right
    flip_sprite()          # Turn NPC sprite accordingly
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Visual Behavior

### **NPC Facing Logic:**

- **Player on left** â†’ NPC sprite flips horizontally (faces left)
- **Player on right** â†’ NPC sprite normal (faces right)
- **Instant response** â†’ No delay or animation (crisp interaction)

### **Works With All NPCs:**

- âœ… **Advisor** - Turns to face when talking about threats
- âœ… **Spy Merchant** - Faces player during intelligence sharing  
- âœ… **Netaji Palkar** - Professional military acknowledgment

## ðŸš€ Testing

### **How to Test:**

1. **Run the game** (F5)
2. **Approach an NPC from different sides** (left, right, behind)
3. **Press E to interact** from each position
4. **Watch NPC turn** to face you before dialogue starts

### **Expected Results:**

- âœ… **NPCs always face player** when interaction begins
- âœ… **Immediate response** (no delay)
- âœ… **Works from any approach angle**
- âœ… **Natural conversation feel**

## ðŸ’¡ Future Enhancements

### **Possible Additions:**

- **Smooth turning animation** (instead of instant flip)
- **NPCs track player movement** while nearby
- **Different facing behaviors** per NPC personality
- **Head turning** before full body turn

---

## ðŸŽ‰ Result

**Much more natural NPC interactions!** Characters now acknowledge the player's presence by turning to face them, making conversations feel more engaging and realistic. ðŸŽ­âœ¨
